# filestore-challenge

Write a program that provides an HTTP API to store and retrieve files. It should support the following features:

Upload a new file
Retrieve an uploaded file by name
Delete an uploaded file by name
Bonus point: include a Vagrantfile so we can use Vagrant to try it out
More bonus point: if multiple files have similar contents, reuse the contents somehow to save space.
You can use any framework or library you are comfortable with. We like Haskell, Nix and PHP so it'll be great if you use them, especially Nix.

What we look for in the project:

Awareness of performance and security implications
Clean code style
Compliance with standards
Enough documentation :)
Appropriate use of tools.
